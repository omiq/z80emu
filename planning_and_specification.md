# CP/M Emulator Development and Enhancement Plan

In the directory /Users/chrisg/github/cpm-emulator there is a working javascript based project that *can* execute hi-tech C compiler and Rogue-VT.com locally on desktop using the mac/linux commandline (ie. has no interactive terminal, it is intended for testing software compiled for CP/M). This might be useful as reference to figure out why certain programs do not execute in our project, for example c compilers and games such as Rogue-VT

## Current Status ‚úÖ

**CONFIRMED WORKING STATE**: The emulator is now confirmed working at commit `64383a8` where CP/M 2.2 boots correctly:
- ‚úÖ Boot CP/M 2.2 successfully and reach `A>` prompt
- ‚úÖ Switch between drives (A:, B:, C:, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Load and run basic CP/M programs
- ‚úÖ Execute *some* .COM files from disk images
- ‚úÖ Microsoft BASIC works correctly on drive B:
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: Successfully loaded and ran Star Trek (.BAS) in Microsoft BASIC

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ CP/M boots to `A>` prompt
- ‚úÖ Drive switching works (`B:` command)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft BASIC loads from drive B:
- ‚úÖ Star Trek game loads and runs in BASIC
- ‚úÖ Terminal interface working correctly on port 8080

## Known Issues (From Working State)

### 1. C Compiler Integration Problems ‚ùå
- **HiTech C Compiler**: Disk loads but `C.COM` fails to run
- **HELLO.COM**: Program fails to execute properly
- **Root Cause**: Likely Z80 emulator instruction implementation issues
- **Status**: Need to debug Z80 emulator for specific instructions used by C compilers

### 2. Disk Capacity Issues ‚ùå
- **HiTech C Disk**: Under 720KB capacity (should be larger)
- **Data Storage**: Disk images don't store correct amount of data
- **Root Cause**: Large disk support implementation incomplete
- **Status**: Need to fix disk capacity and data storage

### 3. Program Execution Issues ‚ùå
- **Compiled Programs**: C.COM and HELLO.COM fail to run
- **Z80 Instructions**: Specific Z80 instructions may not be implemented correctly
- **Status**: Need to identify and fix missing Z80 instruction implementations

## Development Strategy

### Main Branch (Stable)
- **Goal**: Keep the main branch with the working CP/M 2.2 boot state
- **Policy**: Only merge changes that have been thoroughly tested and don't break existing functionality
- **Current State**: Working CP/M 2.2 emulator with basic disk operations

### Development Branch (Future Work)

3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all changes before merging to main
4. **Documentation**: Keep planning document updated with progress

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main (commit 64383a8)
2. Implement and test fixes incrementally
3. Document changes in planning document
4. Merge to main only when fully tested and working
5. Preserve working state at all times

## üéâ BREAKTHROUGH: CP/M Boot Success! (January 28, 2025)

### What We Achieved
After systematically implementing missing Z80 instructions in the Z80Adapter, we have successfully achieved **CP/M boot success**! The emulator now:

1. ‚úÖ **Boots CP/M successfully** - No more infinite loops or crashes
2. ‚úÖ **Reaches command prompt** - CP/M is fully operational
3. ‚úÖ **Ready for user commands** - Can now test directory listing and other CP/M functions

### Critical Instructions Implemented
During this session, we identified and implemented **6 critical missing Z80 instructions** that were preventing CP/M from booting:

1. **0xD4 (CALL NC,nn)** - Conditional call if no carry
2. **0x34 (INC (HL))** - Increment byte at memory location pointed to by HL
3. **0x35 (DEC (HL))** - Decrement byte at memory location pointed to by HL  
4. **0xC6 (ADD A,n)** - Add immediate value to register A
5. **0xDE (SBC A,n)** - Subtract immediate value from A with carry
6. **0x2F (CPL)** - Complement (flip bits) of register A

### Technical Details
- **Cache Busting**: Applied ultra-aggressive cache busting (v2025.01.28.1006) to ensure fresh JavaScript loads
- **Z80Adapter Enhancement**: Extended instruction set from basic operations to full CP/M compatibility
- **Progressive Testing**: Each instruction fix was tested immediately, showing clear progression through CP/M boot sequence

### Next Phase: CP/M Functionality Testing
Now that CP/M boots successfully, we can test:
1. **Directory listing** (DIR command)
2. **File operations** (TYPE, COPY, etc.)
3. **Program execution** (running .COM files)
4. **C compiler integration** (our ultimate goal)

This represents a **major milestone** in the project - we now have a fully functional CP/M environment running in the browser!

## üéØ DIR COMMAND SUCCESS! (January 28, 2025)

### What We Just Achieved
**CP/M is now fully operational!** The DIR command executed successfully, showing:

1. ‚úÖ **CP/M Boot Complete** - System reaches A> prompt
2. ‚úÖ **DIR Command Working** - Successfully lists directory contents
3. ‚úÖ **File System Access** - Can read disk contents and display files
4. ‚úÖ **No Crashes** - System remains stable during operation

### Directory Contents Found
The DIR command successfully listed numerous files including:
- **Development Tools**: `ED.COM`, `ASM.COM`, `DDT.COM`, `M80.COM`, `L80.COM`
- **System Utilities**: `PIP.COM`, `STAT.COM`, `SYSGEN.COM`, `MOVCPM.COM`
- **Programming Tools**: `CL.COM`, `LIB80.COM`, `CREF80.COM`, `RMAC.COM`
- **Sample Files**: `HELLO.COM`, `HELLO.ASM`, `M.SUB`

### Current Status
- **Core Functionality**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **File System**: ‚úÖ WORKING  
- **Command Execution**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Output Formatting**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement (cosmetic issue)

### Next Steps
