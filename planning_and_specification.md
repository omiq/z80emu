# CP/M Emulator Development and Enhancement Plan

Important guardrails:
- Use the combined key approach (prefix*0x100 + opcode) for CB prefix instructions like 0xCBFC.
- If CB FC already exists, say "already implemented" and stop.

## Reference project

In the directory /Users/chrisg/github/cpm-emulator there is a working javascript based project that *can* execute hi-tech C compiler and Rogue-VT.com locally on desktop using the mac/linux commandline (ie. has no interactive terminal, it is intended for testing software compiled for CP/M). This might be useful as reference to figure out why certain programs do not execute in our project, for example c compilers and games such as Rogue-VT

## Current Status ‚úÖ

**ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**: Currently implementing missing Z80 instructions for CP/M compatibility on branch `feature/z80-library-integration` (commit `7d8ee39`):

1. **0xD4 (CALL NC,nn)** - Conditional call if no carry
2. **0x34 (INC (HL))** - Increment byte at memory location pointed to by HL
3. **0x35 (DEC (HL))** - Decrement byte at memory location pointed to by HL  
4. **0xC6 (ADD A,n)** - Add immediate value to register A
5. **0xDE (SBC A,n)** - Subtract immediate value from A with carry
6. **0x2F (CPL)** - Complement (flip bits) of register A

#### Basic Z80 Instructions
- **0x38** (JR C,d) - Jump Relative if Carry flag set
- **0x30** (JR NC,d) - Jump Relative if No Carry flag
- **0x20** (JR NZ,d) - Jump Relative if Not Zero

#### CB Prefix Instructions (Bit Manipulation)
- **0xCB3F** (SRL A) - Shift Right Logical A register

#### DD Prefix Instructions (IX Register Operations)
- **0xDD36** (LD (IX+d),n) - Store immediate value to IX+displacement
- **0xDD75** (LD (IX+d),L) - Store L register to IX+displacement

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identified systematic patterns in missing instructions (indexed addressing, conditional jumps, stack operations)
- **Reference Implementation**: Used `js8080.js` as authoritative source for instruction logic and cycle counts
- **Progressive Testing**: Each instruction fix tested immediately with HELLO.COM execution

### Current Z80 Instruction Coverage
Our Z80Adapter now supports:

#### ‚úÖ Complete Instruction Categories

- **Bit Manipulation Operations**: SRL A - Shift Right Logical

### Systematic Approach
1. **Error-Driven Development**: Each "UNIMPLEMENTED INSTRUCTION" error guides our next implementation
2. **Pattern-Based Implementation**: Similar instructions follow established patterns
3. **Immediate Testing**: Each fix tested with HELLO.COM execution
4. **Cache Management**: Aggressive cache busting ensures fresh JavaScript loads
5. **Documentation**: Each instruction documented with proper cycle counts and flag handling

### Next Steps
1. **Continue HELLO.COM Testing**: Implement remaining missing instructions as encountered
2. **Complete Z80 Instruction Set**: Build out comprehensive instruction coverage
3. **C Compiler Integration**: Once HELLO.COM runs successfully, test C.COM
4. **MBASIC Testing**: Test Microsoft BASIC execution
5. **Full CP/M Compatibility**: Ensure all CP/M programs can run

### Current Status
- **HELLO.COM Progress**: Successfully implementing missing instructions one by one
- **Instruction Coverage**: Comprehensive Z80 instruction set with indexed addressing, conditional jumps, stack operations, and bit manipulation
- **Cache Busting**: Version v2025.01.28.1051 with aggressive cache management
- **Testing Strategy**: Systematic error-driven development with immediate validation

**This systematic approach is building a robust, complete Z80 emulator capable of running complex CP/M programs including C compilers!**

- **Result**: CP/M continued boot sequence

#### 3. XOR E Instruction (0xAB) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Problem**: `UNIMPLEMENTED INSTRUCTION: 0xab at PC=0x3975`
- **Root Cause**: Missing XOR E instruction implementation
- **Solution**: Added XOR E instruction to instruction table
- **Implementation**: `this.a = this.xorByte(this.a, this.e)` (XOR E with A)
- **Cycles**: 4 T-states
- **Result**: CP/M continued boot sequence

### Technical Details
- **Cache Busting**: Updated to v=2025-09-05_18.56.05
- **Documentation**: Updated z80_instructions.md with correct instruction keys
- **Progress Tracking**: CP/M successfully advancing through boot sequence (PC: 0x053f ‚Üí 0x3972 ‚Üí 0x3975)
- **Method**: Systematic error-driven development with immediate testing

### Next Steps
1. **Continue monitoring** for additional missing instructions
2. **Implement instructions** as they are encountered during CP/M boot
3. **Maintain documentation** with each instruction addition
4. **Track progress** through PC advancement in boot sequence

### Lessons Learned
- **Instruction Key Accuracy**: Critical to use correct hex values for combined prefix+opcode keys
- **Error-Driven Development**: Effective approach for building complete instruction set
- **Documentation**: Essential to maintain detailed progress trail
- **Cache Management**: Important to update cache busting with each change

**Current Status**: CP/M boot sequence progressing successfully with systematic instruction implementation
