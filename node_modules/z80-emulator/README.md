# z80-emulator

This is a TypeScript-based Z80 emulator. It passes the 1356 tests of the
[z80-test](../z80-test) project. The code
that executes the opcodes (`Decode.ts`) is generated by the
`GenerateOpcodes.ts` program and the various data files in the `opcodes`
directory:

    % npm install
    % npm run generate

To run the regression suite:

    % npm run test

To use the Z80 in your own project, implement the `Hal` interface.
See the [TRS-80 Model III emulator](../trs80-emulator)
project for a web example and the
[CP/M emulator](https://github.com/lkesteloot/cpm-emulator) project for a Node.js example.
